This is a project done for CS152 course under Proffesor Amitabha Sanyal. This was done in language Racket and it's aim is to solve Art gallery problem.
So to begin and explore art gallery theorom and it's algorithm 
=> you need to install DrRacket IDE.
=> open begin.rkt, make necessary changes at line 31 of code (It is the location of picture, change it to location of image present along with this folder) and there you go. Enter number of sides of Polygon and there you go, give input of polygon as points in CLOCKWISE order to obtain triangulation of polygon and minimum number of cameras.

For more about Art Gallery Problem :

Also i have included the books we used for searching good algorithms to solve the problem.
